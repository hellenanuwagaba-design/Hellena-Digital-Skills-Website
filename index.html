    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <div class="dash"></div>
    <p>
      I am a part-time postgraduate taught student in my second year of Sustainable Lands and Cities.
      I am interested in digital skills because I enjoy challenging myself and learning something new.

    <p>
      This digital capability report shows my self-assessment across different areas of digital skills.
      It helped me understand my strengths and identify areas for improvement as I continue developing my digital confidence.

  <p>
    I have chosen to focus on data & digital literacy, problem-solving, and curiosity because together they form a strong foundation for becoming a confident digital specialist. I want my activity to produce clear, usable results, not just learning for its own sake, so my goal is to turn new skills into simple outputs (charts, a dashboard, short reports, or small demos) that others can use to make decisions or to improve a process. That is how I will create impact and deliver the objectives of my Award project: by producing evidence-backed, repeatable work that shows real progress.

  <p>
    I’ve already used basic tools, raw graphs, simple Tableau dashboards, and beginner Python/R, which showed me how powerful data can be. I also noticed that I often suggest quick fixes without fully checking the facts. That pushed me to pick data skills (to understand the evidence), problem-solving (to test and choose good solutions), and curiosity (to keep learning useful tools and not get stuck in one way of thinking).
  </p>

  <h3>What the skills mean to me</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data & digital literacy:</strong> the ability to find, clean, analyze, and present information so people can understand it. This includes spreadsheets, simple code, dashboards, and clear visuals.</li>
    <li><strong>Problem solving:</strong> a step-by-step way to move from spotting an issue to testing and applying a practical solution, defining the problem, gathering facts, trying options, and learning from the results.</li>
    <li><strong>Curiosity:</strong> an ongoing habit of asking good questions, trying small experiments, and turning interest into finished small projects instead of just browsing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The plan</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Complete weekly mini projects for steady practice.</li>
    <li>Follow a structured learning path for intermediate Python or R, focused on data cleaning and analysis.</li>
    <li>Take short courses on reproducible workflows (notebooks, basic Git) via LinkedIn Learning or Coursera.</li>
    <li>Apply a defined test reflection routine to at least two real problems during the year, documenting steps and results.</li>
    <li>Keep a weekly learning journal with one question and one takeaway, and attend a relevant seminar monthly, turning one idea from each seminar into a tiny project.</li>
    <li>Request monthly feedback from a mentor to stay accountable.</li>
  </ul>
